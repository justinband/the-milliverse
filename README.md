# The Milliverse

## What is the Milliverse?

Great question! Born from the minds of seven university students, the Milliverse is a thought experiment involving millipedes, learning to count, a cult about millipedes and worms, unrealistic evolutionary scenarios, more millipedes, and what it means to be more than the sum of your extremities. 

## What is this repository for? 

This is where short stories and other writings set in the fictional world of the _Milliverse_ live. So, naturally, if you wish to contribute to the Milliverse, this is the place for you to be! 

(_Actually, it's for expressing my commitment to a bizarre inside joke._)

## Should you care about the Milliverse?
